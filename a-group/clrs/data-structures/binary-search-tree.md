# Binary Search Tree

The search tree data structure supports many dynamic-set operations, including SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, PREDECESSOR, SUCCESSOR, INSERT, and DELETE. Thus, we can use a search tree both as a dictionary and as a priority queue.

The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to satisfy the binary-search-tree property: 

{% hint style="info" %}
Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y.key &lt;= x.key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y.key &gt;= x.key.
{% endhint %}
