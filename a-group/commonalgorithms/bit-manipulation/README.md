# Bit Manipulation

## **Bitwise Operators**

$$N = 5 = (101)_2, A = 5 = (101)_2 $$ and$$B = 3 = (011)_2$$ 

#### **NOT \( ~ \)**

Bitwise NOT is an unary operator that flips the bits of the number i.e., if the ith bit is 0, it will change it to 1 and vice versa.

 $$\sim N = \sim 5 = \sim (101)_2 = (010)_2$$

 **AND \( & \)**

Bitwise AND is a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 1, otherwise 0.

$$
A\  \& \ B = (101)_2 \ \& \ (011)_2 = (001)_2 = 1
$$

 **OR \( \| \)**

**I**f both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1.

A \| B = \(101\)2 \| \(011\)2 = \(111\)2 = 7

$$
A | B = (101)_2 | (011)_2 = (111)_2 = 7
$$

 **XOR \( ^ \)**

Bitwise XOR also takes two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0 or 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1.

A ^ B = \(101\)2 ^ \(011\)2 = \(110\)2 = 6

$$
A\ ^ {\wedge} \ B = (101)_2 \ ^ {\wedge} \  (011)_2=(110)_2 = 6
$$
